My goal is to spend four hours a day on work with intent1. For a sanity, efficiency, and inspiration, I intend to balance my time between three categories: research, \\(\\Phi\\); skills, \\(\\theta\\); and busywork, \\(\\psi\\). 1.1 signifiers todo: create a signifiers sheet measures %&gt;% pluck(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;signifiers&quot;) %&gt;% select(-LaTeX) %&gt;% knitr::kable() signifier meaning placement quaver today 4 * priority 5 i, ii, … project 4 ~ anxiety 5 NA task 1 phi research 2 theta skills 2 psi busywork 2 plus project 3 magnifying glass look into 3 This term is adopted from a piano teacher that I studied under, that I subsequently adapted into my own teaching. She encouraged me to practice with intent; that is, play what you intend to play. I found this to be particularly useful for discouraging my students, and myself, from the age-old pitfall of playing a piece of music until you make a mistake and stopping and playing that section over until you get it right. It’s better to play through the piece, which empBowers you to adapt to mistakes you will inevitably play and, most importantly, not lose time. Oddly, it appeared to be a universal misconception, myself included, that without careful consideration, the attempt to get the notes right inevitably means the rhythm is wrong, and thus you get nothing right after all. Best, therefore, to play through the piece. I use my bullet journal to help me focus on work with intent; I’ve found the simplicity of only timing work when I’ve written down what I intend to do has been extraordinarily powerful in helping me complete daunting tasks.↩ "],

["intro.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction", " Chapter 3 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 3. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 5. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 3.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 3.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 3.1: Here is a nice table!
