Keeps screens busy and helps me focus. 4.4 work with intent This term is adopted from a piano teacher that I studied under, that I subsequently adapted into my own teaching. She encouraged me to practice with intent; that is, play what you intend to play. I found this to be particularly useful for discouraging my students, and myself, from the age-old pitfall of playing a piece of music until you make a mistake and stopping and playing that section over until you get it right. It’s better to play through the piece, which empowers you to adapt to mistakes you will inevitably play and, most importantly, not lose time. Oddly, it appeared to be a universal misconception, myself included, that without careful consideration, the attempt to get the notes right inevitably means the rhythm is wrong, and thus you get nothing right after all. Best, therefore, to play through the piece. I use my bullet journal to help me focus on work with intent; I’ve found the simplicity of only timing work when I’ve written down what I intend to do has been extraordinarily powerful in helping me complete daunting tasks. 4.5 \\(\\sim\\) beethoven piano sonata todo: https://twitter.com/cantabile/status/1112145903203180544 "]
