# Advance three dots each day, for up to three manuscripts

[Instantiate](#instantiate), at the beginning, thereafter turn to writing tracker. 

Count completed sections, and estimate how much of the manuscript has been completed. Add three to that and set this as the **goal** for the day. 

Set **n = 3**.

1. Randomly select **n** sections from those with the least number of dots in their corresponding row in the writing tracker. 

```{r}
# for example
tracker %>% 
  mutate(heading = rep("x", 3),
         sentence = c("x", "", "x"),
         paragraph = c("x", "", "")) %>% 
  kable() 

```


2. Write as separate tasks in bullet journal. 

3. Actioning one of these means attempting to complete one dot: heading, sentence, paragraph, etc. 

4. Cross action as complete when completed, or if the pomodoro runs out. Consider adding subsections to tracker if action incomplete.

5. If **goal** is not met, set **n = goal - number of poms completed**.  If **goal** is met, stop and switch to next manuscript. If third manuscript, only continue for fun. 

# Instantiate writing tracker table {#instantiate} 

Set three sections before beginning, as any piece of scientific writing  will have an introduction, motivating content, content section, doing the science, and conclusion of content's findings. 

```{r}

tracker %>% 
  kable() 

```
