What if one practices mathematical science like music?

My goal is to spend four hours a day on [work with intent](#work-with-intent).

For a sanity, efficiency, and inspiration, I intend to balance my time between three categories: 

- research, $\varphi$; 
- skills, $\theta$;  
- busywork, $\psi$; and
- wellness, $\pi$
