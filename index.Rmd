library(dontpanic)
library(lubridate)
library(googlesheets)
library(kableExtra)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(

What if one practices mathematical science like music?

My goal is to spend four hours a day on [work with intent](#work-with-intent). I wish to live a life with intent; as I have seen how much unhappiness it can bring to live without. 

For sanity, efficiency, and inspiration, I intend to balance my time between categories: 

- research, $\varphi$; 
- skills, $\theta$;  
- busywork, $\psi$; and
- wellness, $\pi$

# what is this?

This manuscript is a triptych of  

- [analysis](#analysis) of my productivity data
- [rituals](#rituals) rituals to facillitate flow in practicing mathematical science
- [ruminations](#ruminations) a reminder to self about why I chose what I did 

## [version](#mindfulness)
