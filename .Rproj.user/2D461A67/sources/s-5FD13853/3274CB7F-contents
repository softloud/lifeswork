What if one practices mathematical science like music?

My goal is to spend four hours a day on *work with intent*[^1].

For a sanity, efficiency, and inspiration, I intend to balance my time between three categories: 

- research, $\Phi$; 
- skills, $\theta$; and 
- busywork, $\psi$.


[^1]: This term is adopted from a piano teacher that I studied under, that I subsequently adapted into my own teaching. She encouraged me to *practice with intent*; that is, play what you intend to play. I found this to be particularly useful for discouraging my students, and myself, from the age-old pitfall of playing a piece of music until you make a mistake and stopping and playing that section over until you get it right. It's better to play *through* the piece, which empBowers you to adapt to mistakes you will inevitably play and, most importantly, not lose time. Oddly, it appeared to be a universal misconception, myself included, that without careful consideration, the attempt to *get the notes right* inevitably means the **rhythm is wrong**, and thus you get nothing right after all. Best, therefore, to play through the piece. I use my bullet journal to help me focus on work with intent; I've found the simplicity of only timing work when I've written down what I intend to do has been extraordinarily powerful in helping me complete daunting tasks.
